# Constructor in enum
* Enums are a data type in programming languages used to define a collection of named constants.
  These constants are typically used to represent a set of discrete values that are meaningful in a specific context.
  Enums make code more readable and self-documenting by replacing magic numbers or strings with descriptive names.

Here are some key points about enums:

1. Named Constants:
Enums allow you to define named constants. For example, instead of using 0 and 1 to represent weekdays and weekends, you can define an enum with the names Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc., making the code more readable and understandable.

2. Distinct Values:
Enumerations represent distinct values, meaning each enum constant is unique within the enum type. This ensures that the values used are restricted to a specific set of options.

3. Sequential Numbers:
Enum values are often assigned sequential integers starting from 0 (although this can be customized). For instance, if you don't specify values for the enum constants, they will be assigned 0, 1
